# codegrid.js - Javascript function to query country code

```codegrid.js``` is a simple javascript library for efficiently retrieving country code from lat-lng coordinates of a point.  The data is encoded in a set of compressed utf-grid json files.

The source can be easily configured and adapted as needed.
